The Web3 Analytics Guidelines technical guide provides end-to-end tutorials on how to analyze specific protocols in web3. The guide covers the basics of analyzing protocols in web3, including how to find what to analyze, metrics-driven analysis, and sharing your work with the community. The guide also includes community guides for Spark SQL and PostgreSQL, which provide additional resources for learning SQL and blockchain concepts. 

The guide starts by explaining that analyzing protocols in web3 is both easy and hard. It is easy because everything is transparent and standardized, but it is also an ever-expanding data battlefield as new protocols, tokens, and wallets join the fray and add to the chaos. The guide then provides tips on how to scope your work when looking into a protocol, including understanding the contract architecture and context, functions, events, and wallets overviews. 

The guide then explains how to perform metrics-driven analysis, which involves understanding token and wallet segments and leveraging labels to enhance your analysis. The guide provides two great end-to-end video series guides for metrics analysis, including Uniswap in 12 Days and Gnosis Safe Point-in-Time. The guide also includes links to an ERC20 dashboard and an NFT dashboard to help understand token trends and contexts. 

Finally, the guide explains how to share your work with the community, including sharing your work in the Discord `#📺︱show-your-work` channel and on Twitter tagging @duneanalytics. The guide also includes a link to the Dune official guides and community guides for Spark SQL and PostgreSQL. 

Overall, the Web3 Analytics Guidelines technical guide is a comprehensive guide for analyzing specific protocols in web3. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to find what to analyze, perform metrics-driven analysis, and share your work with the community. The guide also includes additional resources for learning SQL and blockchain concepts.

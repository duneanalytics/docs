      "summary": "This app technical guide provides instructions on how to set up the file structure for SQL, schema, and source files in the Dune Docs project. The guide explains that all Spells are stored in the `/spellbook/models` directory by project name, then blockchain network. The folder names are all lowercase, and words are separated by underscores. The guide provides an example of the folder structure for the Keep3r network, where the folder is `/spellbook/models/keep3r_network/ethereum`. \n\nThe guide explains that if the project folder exists but a Spell is being created for a new blockchain, a folder for the new blockchain should be created. The guide then explains that three files need to be created: a `.sql` file for the Spell's logic, a `_schema.yml` file to define the Spell's purpose and add generic tests, descriptions, metadata, etc., and a `_sources.yml` file with any project-specific table dependencies. The guide provides an example of the file structure for a Spell folder.\n\nThe guide also explains the naming convention for Spell files. Schema files are named `[project_name]_[blockchain]_schema.yml`, sources files are named `[project_name]_[blockchain]_sources.yml`, and SQL files for Spells are named `[project_name]_[blockchain]_[spell_name].sql`. \n\nThe guide then provides an example of a specific v1 migration example where three additional `.sql` files are needed for a Spell called `keep3r_network_ethereum_view_job_log.sql`. The guide explains that these files are needed because the original `view_job_log.sql` V1 Abstraction has two `FROM` statements that reference two other files that are also abstractions that need to be converted into Spells. The guide also explains that a recursive check needs to be done to see if those abstractions depend on any other abstractions that have yet to be migrated to Spells. \n\nOverall, this app technical guide provides a detailed explanation of how to set up the file structure for Spells in the Dune Docs project and provides examples to help users understand the process.",

The app requires the creation of three files: a `.sql` file for the Spell's logic, a `_schema.yml` file for defining the spell's purpose and adding metadata, and a `_sources.yml` file for project-specific table dependencies.\n\n3. How does the app handle dependencies between Spells and abstractions in the migration process?\n- The app requires a recursive check to see if abstractions depend on any other abstractions that have yet to be migrated to Spells. The app also requires the creation of additional `.sql` files for Spells that depend on other abstractions, and these dependencies are identified by searching for `FROM` statements in the original abstractions."

The guide starts by explaining that the endpoint is `_view_job_log.sql`, but the process should start with `_view_job_migrations.sql` because it is the lowest-level dependency. The guide then explains how to migrate from V1 abstraction to V2 Spell by copying the contents of the V1 file to the `keep3r_network_ethereum_view_job_migrations.sql` file. The guide explains that the `CREATE` or `REPLACE` definition statement is not needed, and everything from the first `SELECT` to the last `TRUE` is required. The guide then explains how to replace hard-coded references with JINJA templating. \n\nThe guide provides examples of SQL code and explains how to modify the syntax to V2/Spark SQL. The guide also explains how to replace hard-coded references with JINJA templating. The guide provides examples of how to format references to sources and models using JINJA. The guide emphasizes the need to test the SQL code in dune.com and fix any errors.

      "summary": "This app technical guide covers the configuration of aliases and materialization strategies in the Spellbook project. The guide explains that materialization strategies are used to persist data in the data lake house and there are four materialization strategies in dbt: table, ephemeral, view, and incremental. Spellbook uses view and incremental strategies. \n\nThe guide explains that view Spells are rebuilt each time they are run, meaning every time someone queries a view Spell, the SQL is run, and fresh data is gathered according to the Spell’s SQL logic. On the other hand, incremental Spells allow dbt to insert or update records in a table according to the logic defined. The guide provides an example of how to create an incremental Spell by including a statement of which column to join new data to the existing data each time the Spell is incremented.\n\nThe guide also explains how to configure aliases and materialization. To configure a Spell’s alias and materialization, the configuration is added to the top of each SQL file. The configuration includes creating an alias for the Spell file that will appear in the dune.com UI, defining how the file is stored and categorized in the UI, and naming the contributors. The guide provides an example of how to configure a Spell’s alias and materialization using a view materialization strategy.\n\nFinally, the guide explains how to add new models to the dbt_project.yml file in the Spellbook root folder. The guide provides an example of how to specify the project name, schema, and materialization strategy for the project as a whole as well as the specific blockchain(s) that Spells have been created for. \n\nOverall, this guide provides a detailed explanation of how to configure aliases and materialization strategies in the Spellbook project. It is a useful resource for developers working on the project who need to configure aliases and materialization strategies for their Spells.",
      "questions": "1. What are the available materialization strategies in dbt and which ones does Spellbook use?\n- The available materialization strategies in dbt are `table`, `ephemeral`, `view`, and `incremental`. Spellbook uses `view` and `incremental`.\n\n2. How does the `incremental` materialization strategy work and what configuration is needed to implement it?\n- The `incremental` materialization strategy allows dbt to insert or update records in a table according to the logic defined. To implement it, the configuration section of the file needs to include a statement of which column to join new data to existing data, specify that it is an incremental Spell, and provide an instruction for how dbt should combine new/old data using `merge`. Additionally, `if` statements need to be added to any `FROM` for which data needs to be incremented.\n\n3. How do you configure a Spell's alias and materialization and where is this configuration added?\n- To configure a Spell's alias and materialization, the configuration is added to the top of each SQL file. The configuration includes creating an alias for the Spell file that will appear in the UI, defining how the file is stored and categorized in the UI, and specifying whether it is a Spell for a specific project or a whole sector. This configuration assumes the use of a `view` materialization strategy."

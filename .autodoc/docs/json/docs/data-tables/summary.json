      "summary": "# Tables and Chains Overview\n\nThis technical guide provides an overview of the tables and chains available in the Dune app. The guide is divided into two main sections: The Four Kinds of Tables and Available Chains.\n\nThe Four Kinds of Tables section explains how Dune ingests data from node providers to create raw tables, which are then decoded using contract ABIs to provide easier to work with decoded tables. Abstracted tables are then created to standardize and aggregate the data, giving users the easiest to work with spell tables. The section also provides links to the raw data, decoded data, spellbook, and community tables.\n\nThe Available Chains section provides a list of the chains available to query in Dune. For each chain, the section provides a brief overview of the chain, its history, and its technical details. The section also includes links to the chain's documentation and other resources.\n\nFor example, the Ethereum Mainnet section provides a brief history of Ethereum, its updates, and its decentralized platform. The section also includes a link to the Ethereum Developer Docs. Similarly, the BNB Chain (BSC) section explains how BNB Chain follows most of the rules of Ethereum Mainnet but has not implemented EIP1559. The section also includes a link to the BNB Chain Documentation.\n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a comprehensive overview of the tables and chains available in the Dune app. It is a useful resource for users who want to understand how Dune ingests data and creates tables, as well as for users who want to query specific chains and understand their technical details.",
      "questions": "1. What kind of data can be queried from the Dune Docs app for each available chain?\n- The app ingests data from node providers to fill raw tables, which are then decoded using contract ABIs to provide decoded tables. Abstracted tables are then created to standardize and aggregate the data, giving users the easiest to work with spell tables. \n\n2. How does the gas calculation differ for transactions on Optimism and Arbitrum compared to Ethereum Mainnet?\n- Optimism processes transactions outside of Ethereum Mainnet, reducing congestion on the base layer and improving scalability. Arbitrum is an optimistic rollup that settles its transactions on Ethereum Mainnet, but its execution environment differs from the Mainnet EVM implementation in its calculation of gas costs. \n\n3. What is the difference between BNB Chain and Ethereum Mainnet in terms of gas fees and fee burning?\n- BNB Chain follows most of the rules of Ethereum Mainnet, but has not implemented EIP1559. Instead, it relies on BEP-95 to burn fees that accrue during usage of the platform. Furthermore, the gas limit per block is set to 100 million, enabling more transactions to be processed in a given block. Transactions fees are paid in BNB instead of ETH."

          "summary": "# Raw Tables\n\nThe Raw Tables section of the Dune Docs project provides users with raw, unfiltered, and unedited data. This allows users to query for any transaction, block, event log, or trace across the blockchains that Dune supports. Raw data tables are particularly useful for obtaining meta information about the blockchain, a transaction, traces, or certain events.\n\nHowever, queries that have been written using raw data tables are notoriously hard to understand and audit due to the nature of the encoded data commonly found in these tables. Furthermore, the raw data tables have a very large number of rows and hence can be slow to query. Most of the time, users are better off submitting contracts for decoding and working with decoded data.\n\n## EVM Raw Table Data\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) powers all chains in Dune except Solana and Bitcoin, meaning they share the base structure for underlying data. The following are the different types of EVM raw table data available in the Dune Docs project:\n\n- **Blocks**: Blocks are the building blocks of blockchains and rollups.\n- **Event Logs**: Event Logs are data that gets generated by smart contracts.\n- **Traces**: Traces contain information about the execution of smaller atomic actions generated by transactions.\n- **Transactions**: Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts.\n\nOverall, the Raw Tables section of the Dune Docs project provides users with a comprehensive guide on how to work with raw data tables. It also highlights the limitations of using raw data tables and suggests alternative methods for working with blockchain data. The section on EVM Raw Table Data provides users with a detailed explanation of the different types of raw data tables available for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and how they can be used.",
          "questions": "1. What types of blockchain data can be queried using raw tables in Dune Docs?\n- Raw tables in Dune Docs allow for querying of any transaction, block, event log, or trace across the blockchains that Dune supports.\n\n2. What are some challenges associated with using raw data tables for queries?\n- Queries written using raw data tables can be difficult to understand and audit due to the encoded data commonly found in these tables. Additionally, raw data tables can have a large number of rows and be slow to query.\n\n3. Which blockchains in Dune Docs are powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?\n- All chains in Dune Docs except for Solana and Bitcoin are powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)."

          "summary": "# Traces\n\nThe Traces tables contain information about the execution of smaller atomic actions generated by transactions. Transactions can trigger smaller atomic actions that modify the internal state of an Ethereum Virtual Machine. Information about the execution of these actions is logged and can be found stored as an EVM execution trace, or just a trace. In Etherscan, these are referred to as \"internal transactions\". The guide provides information on the tables and column data of the traces.\n\n## Tables\n\nThe tables are divided into two engines, V1 and V2. The V2 engine uses Spark SQL, while the V1 engine uses PostgreSQL. The tables are divided by chain and contain information such as the value measured in wei, gas, gas used, block hash, success, tx index, sub-traces, error, tx success, tx hash, from, to, trace address, type, address, code, call type, input, and output. \n\n## Column Data\n\nThe column data provides a detailed description of the data types and their descriptions. For instance, the `block_time` column is of type `timestamptz` and represents the time when the block was mined. The `value` column is of type `numeric` and represents the amount of `[chain_gas_token]` sent in this transaction. The `gas` column is of type `numeric` and represents the gas provided with the message call. The `gas_used` column is of type `numeric` and represents the gas consumed by the transaction in wei. The `success` column is of type `boolean` and represents a true/false value that shows if the trace action succeeded. \n\n## Gas used in `.traces`\n\nThe `gas_used` column in the `.traces` tables is a bit hard to understand. The `gas_used` of a trace will always include the gas consumed by the trace and all its subtraces. The `gas_used` of the initial call will not contain the cost of making the call in the first place. You need to add 21000 gas units + the cost of sending zero + non-zero bytes to the `gas_used` value of the top trace to arrive at the \"true\" `gas_used` value. \n\n## Creation Traces\n\nThe creation traces table contains information about the creation of a smart contract and the transfer of ether to it. The table is divided by chain and contains information such as block time, block number, tx hash, address, from, and code. \n\nThe guide provides examples of the tables and column data. For instance, the guide provides an example of the V2 engine (Spark SQL) table for Ethereum Mainnet. The guide also provides an example of the creation traces table for Ethereum Mainnet. \n\nOverall, the guide provides a detailed explanation of the Traces tables and column data. It also provides examples of the tables and column data.",
          "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `traces` tables in the different chains listed in the guide?\n- The `traces` tables contain information about the execution of smaller atomic actions generated by transactions in different chains listed in the guide.\n\n2. What is the difference between the V1 and V2 engines in terms of the PostgreSQL database used?\n- The V1 engine uses PostgreSQL while the V2 engine uses Spark SQL.\n\n3. What is the `gas_used` column in the `.traces` tables and how is it calculated?\n- The `gas_used` column in the `.traces` tables includes the gas consumed by the trace and all its subtraces, but not the cost of making the call in the first place. To arrive at the \"true\" `gas_used` value, 21000 gas units plus the cost of sending zero and non-zero bytes should be added to the `gas_used` value of the top trace."

          "summary": "# Transactions\n\nThis section of the app technical guide covers transactions in the Ethereum network. Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts that initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. Transactions always originate from externally owned accounts, and a smart contract cannot initiate a transaction. Transactions need to be broadcast to the whole network, and any node can broadcast a request for a transaction to be executed on the EVM. After this happens, a miner will execute the transaction and propagate the resulting state change to the rest of the network. \n\nThe official Ethereum documentation provides more information on transactions [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions).\n\n## Tables\n\nThis section of the app technical guide provides a table of the V2 Engine (Spark SQL) and V1 Engine (PosgreSQL) for different chains.

              "summary": "# Solana Technical Guide\n\nThis technical guide provides information on Solana's raw data and how it differs from other chains. The guide is divided into two main sections: Data Available and Changelog.\n\n## Data Available\n\nThis section provides a list of tables available in Solana's data. The tables are:\n\n- Account Activity: This table contains information from the transactions table focused on account usage.\n- Blocks: Blocks are the building blocks of blockchains and rollups.\n- Rewards: This table contains data about rewards paid out on Solana.\n- Transactions: Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts.\n- Vote Transactions: This table contains the full set of vote transactions that are submitted by validators to vote on a block.\n\n## Changelog\n\nThis section provides a list of changes made to Solana's data. The changes are:\n\n### 2022-03-25\n\nThe `solana.account_activity` table has been updated to a new version. The new version of the table contains additional information around token activity. The following columns were added to the table:\n\n- `pre_token_balances`: The token balance before the transaction was processed.\n- `post_token_balances`: The token balance after the transaction was processed.\n- `token_balance_changes`: The balance change that occurred as part of the transaction.\n\n### 2022-03-18\n\nThe `solana.account_activity` table was released. The table contains all of the information about an account’s usage in a transaction. The table is optimized to run with ‘WHERE address = …’ queries.\n\n### 2022-03-01\n\nThe `solana.transactions` table has been upgraded to a new version. The new version of the table uses cleaner array structs to make it easier to extract useful information. The vote transactions have also been split into their own table `solana.vote_transactions`, so queries using `solana.transactions` will have better performance. Unfortunately, the table change also means that some existing queries will now break and need to be changed.\n\nThe changes made to the `solana.transactions` table are:\n\n- You won't need to check if a transaction is a vote transaction, which has typically been done with `WHERE ARRAY_CONTAINS(account_keys, \"Vote111111111111111111111111111111111111111\") = false`.\n- The `error_index` and `error_message` columns have been removed, and have been merged into the `error` column (which is a struct). So now instead of `WHERE error_index is not null`, a query should do `WHERE error is not null`.\n- Structs containing indexes to `account_keys` now include the account address directly, so there is no need to use the `account_keys` column to look up the account addresses.\n- The `pre_token_balances` and `post_token_balances` columns have changed. The token balance is now included in the field `amount`. And as mentioned above, the struct in the array now has a field `account`, which is the account of the token balance.\n- The `instructions` column has changed. As mentioned above, the struct in the array now has a field `executing_account`, which is the account executing the instruction.\n- The `inner_instructions` column is removed, and inner instructions have been moved into the `instructions` column.\n\nIn summary, this technical guide provides information on Solana's raw data and the available tables. It also highlights the changes made to the `solana.account_activity` and `solana.transactions` tables. The guide is useful for developers who want to work with Solana's data and need to understand the changes made to the tables.",
              "questions": "1. What is Solana and how does it differ from other chains?\n- Solana is a non-EVM chain and its raw data looks different from other chains. \n\n2. What data is available in Solana and what information does each table contain?\n- Solana has several tables available, including account activity, blocks, rewards, transactions, and vote transactions. Each table contains specific data related to its name.\n\n3. What changes were made to the Solana tables in the latest update and how might this affect existing queries?\n- The latest update added new columns to the `solana.account_activity` table and split vote transactions into their own table. Existing queries may need to be updated to reflect changes in column names and structures."

The guide provides an example of the folder structure for the Keep3r network, where the folder is `/spellbook/models/keep3r_network/ethereum`. \n\nThe guide explains that if the project folder exists but a Spell is being created for a new blockchain, a folder for the new blockchain should be created. The guide then explains that three files need to be created: a `.sql` file for the Spell's logic, a `_schema.yml` file to define the Spell's purpose and add generic tests, descriptions, metadata, etc., and a `_sources.yml` file with any project-specific table dependencies. The guide provides an example of the file structure for a Spell folder.\n\nThe guide also explains the naming convention for Spell files.

The guide explains that materialization strategies are used to persist data in the data lake house and there are four materialization strategies in dbt: table, ephemeral, view, and incremental. Spellbook uses view and incremental strategies. \n\nThe guide explains that view Spells are rebuilt each time they are run, meaning every time someone queries a view Spell, the SQL is run, and fresh data is gathered according to the Spell’s SQL logic. On the other hand, incremental Spells allow dbt to insert or update records in a table according to the logic defined. The guide provides an example of how to create an incremental Spell by including a statement of which column to join new data to the existing data each time the Spell is incremented.\n\nThe guide also explains how to configure aliases and materialization. To configure a Spell’s alias and materialization, the configuration is added to the top of each SQL file. The configuration includes creating an alias for the Spell file that will appear in the dune.com UI, defining how the file is stored and categorized in the UI, and naming the contributors. The guide provides an example of how to configure a Spell’s alias and materialization using a view materialization strategy.\n\nFinally, the guide explains how to add new models to the dbt_project.yml file in the Spellbook root folder.

Spellbook uses `view` and `incremental`.\n\n2. How does the `incremental` materialization strategy work and what configuration is needed to implement it?\n- The `incremental` materialization strategy allows dbt to insert or update records in a table according to the logic defined. To implement it, the configuration section of the file needs to include a statement of which column to join new data to existing data, specify that it is an incremental Spell, and provide an instruction for how dbt should combine new/old data using `merge`. Additionally, `if` statements need to be added to any `FROM` for which data needs to be incremented.\n\n3. How do you configure a Spell's alias and materialization and where is this configuration added?\n- To configure a Spell's alias and materialization, the configuration is added to the top of each SQL file. The configuration includes creating an alias for the Spell file that will appear in the UI, defining how the file is stored and categorized in the UI, and specifying whether it is a Spell for a specific project or a whole sector. This configuration assumes the use of a `view` materialization strategy."

The purpose of this feature is to sum all transfers for the day. The table is materialized as an incrementally loaded table updated every 15 minutes because the next step includes a slower `[window](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-window.html)` function to capture a rolling sum.\n\nThe guide explains the novel components that make this Spell incremental. The `<div data-gb-custom-block data-tag=\"if\"> </div>` JINJA block allows the addition of an arbitrary filter when running in “incremental” mode. Incremental mode is default and a full refresh is denoted by a command line arg to completely recreate the table. The block is used to filter for all data timestamped in the last two days. The model runs every fifteen minutes, but a look back of 2 days is allowed to account for data arriving late from the blockchain.\n\nTo avoid duplicates, a “`merge`” incremental\\_strategy is used. Merge strategies require a unique key and deduplicate the table upon each update. The guide shows that a unique key is created by coalescing several transfer features together that are utilized here.\n\nThe guide also introduces the first use of “refs” in this spellset. A ref, like `{{ ref('tokens_ethereum_erc20') }}` is simply a reference to another model in the DBT project. The ref references the name of the file itself. That means, duplicate file names cannot exist.\n\nThe guide provides an example of the `transfers_ethereum_erc20_agg_day.sql` file, which contains the SQL code for the daily aggregation feature. The code includes a configuration block that specifies the alias, materialized, file format, incremental strategy, and unique key. The SQL code also includes a select statement that retrieves the required data and a group by statement that groups the data by the required fields.\n\nThe guide also provides an example of the `transfers_ethereum_schema.yml` file, which contains the schema for the Ethereum transfers. The schema includes the name of the transfer, the blockchain, the sector, the project, the contributors, the tags, and the columns. The columns include the blockchain, the hour, the wallet address, the token address, the symbol, the amount raw, and the amount USD.\n\nIn summary, this section of the app technical guide provides a detailed explanation of the daily aggregation feature of the Dune Docs project. It explains the novel components that make this Spell incremental, provides examples of the SQL code and schema files, and introduces the concept of refs.",

This guide provides an overview of the app and its features.\n\n## Overview\n\nDecentralized exchanges are the backbone of the DeFi industry, allowing users to swap any native (ETH) or ERC-20 token for any ERC-20 token through smart contracts. However, with so many decentralized exchanges available, it can be challenging to work with the smart contract data for all of them. Dex.Trades solves this problem by standardizing and normalizing trading data across virtually all relevant decentralized exchanges.\n\n## Column Data\n\nThe Dex.Trades table contains the following columns:\n\n- `block_time`: The timestamp of the block that included this transaction.\n- `token_a_symbol`: The symbol of one of the two tokens that got traded.\n- `token_b_symbol`: The symbol of one of the two tokens that got traded.\n- `token_a_amount`: The amount of token A that got traded.\n- `token_b_amount`: The amount of token B that got traded.\n- `project`: The DEX on which this trade was executed.\n- `version`: Which version of the DEX got used?\n- `blockchain`: Which blockchain did this occur on?\n- `taker`: Which contract called the DEX contract?\n- `maker`: In some special cases, there actually is a counterparty to transactions, and this party will get displayed here if applicable.\n- `token_a_amount_raw`: The raw amount of token A that got traded.\n- `token_b_amount_raw`: The raw amount of token B that got traded.\n- `usd_amount`: The USD value of this trade.\n- `token_a_address`: The ERC-20 token contract address of token A.\n- `token_b_address`: The ERC-20 token contract address of token B.\n- `exchange_contract_address`: The address of the decentralized exchange contract that made this trade possible.\n- `tx_hash`: The hash of the transaction that contained this trade.\n- `tx_from`: Which address initiated this transaction?\n- `tx_to`: What was the first smart contract that got called during this tx?\n- `trace_address`: Which position in the graph tree does the execution of the trade have?\n- `evt_index`: This logs index position in the block (cumulative amount of logs ordered by execution).\n- `trade_id`: Just for database magic.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Dex.Trades app is an essential tool for anyone looking to work with decentralized exchanges. By aggregating data across multiple DEX platforms into one simple table, Dex.Trades makes it easy to query for trading data for your favorite tokens without having to deal with all of the different DEX smart contracts yourself. The scripts that generate the table can be found in the public Github repo.",

              "summary": "# Prices\n\nThis technical guide covers the `Prices` feature of the Dune Docs project. The `Prices` feature allows users to get the price of almost all relevant ERC20 tokens. The data is pulled from the Coinpaprika API and the price is the volume-weighted price based on real-time market data, translated to USD.\n\nThe guide provides two tables for getting prices: `prices.usd` and `prices_from_dex_data`. The `prices.usd` table supports a range of ERC20 tokens. If the token you desire is not listed in this table, you can make a pull request to the GitHub repository. The `prices_from_dex_data` table creates price feeds based on decentralized exchange trading data. This table covers much more assets than `prices.usd`, since it covers all assets that are traded on any of the decentralized exchanges that are indexed in `dex.trades`. However, this table is very resource-intensive and can only be updated every few hours. Also, the resolution is only hourly, so if you need minutely prices, you should refer to `prices.usd`.\n\nThe guide provides a detailed explanation of how the `prices_from_dex_data` table works. The script generates median hourly prices based on data from decentralized exchanges found in `dex.trades`. It assigns asset prices based on a trading pair which has a price feed in `prices.usd`. For example, if the $SPELL/ETH pool is used, the $ETH price is contained in `prices.usd`, but the $SPELL price is not. In order to get the $SPELL price, the script will dynamically calculate the price of $SPELL based on the price of $ETH that was exchanged for it. The guide provides an example of how this calculation is done.\n\nThe guide also highlights known issues with the `prices_from_dex_data` table. In rare cases, the script will generate price feeds that are based on illiquid pairs and therefore report wrong data. This happens when all liquid trading pools of this token do not have a price feed in `prices.usd`. The guide provides an example of how this issue can occur and how to manually construct a price feed in such cases.\n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a comprehensive explanation of the `Prices` feature of the Dune Docs project, including how to use the `prices.usd` and `prices_from_dex_data` tables, how the `prices_from_dex_data` table works, and known issues with the table.",

The guide is aimed at individuals who will be working with fungible (ERC20) and non-fungible (ERC721 and ERC1155) tokens in their analysis. The guide provides information on two metadata tables and two transfer tables that are essential for working with tokens.\n\nThe metadata tables include:\n\n1. `tokens.erc20`: This table contains useful information such as the token `symbol` and the `decimals` for any given `contract_address`. The `decimals` information is needed to get the actual amount from raw amounts in on-chain data.\n\n2. `tokens.nft`: This table contains the collection `name` and `symbol` for any given `contract_address`.\n\nThese tables are usually joined on `contract_address` at the end of a query to make everything more human-readable.\n\nThe transfer tables include:\n\n1. `erc20_ethereum.evt_Transfer`: This table contains all transfer events for every ERC20 token. The guide provides a link to a video guide that explains how to get ERC20 balances, mints, and burns.\n\n2. `nft.transfers`: This table contains all transfer events for every ERC721 or ERC1155 token. The guide provides a link to a guide that explains how to leverage this table to find NFT balances, transfers, and mints.\n\nIf you're looking for information on how to calculate native token balances like Ethereum (ETH) balances, the guide provides a link to another guide that covers this topic.\n\nOverall, this section of the app technical guide provides essential information for individuals working with tokens in their analysis. The metadata and transfer tables are crucial for understanding token transfers and metadata, and the guide provides links to additional resources for further learning.",

  "summary": "The Decoded Tables guide in the `.autodoc/docs/json/docs/data-tables/decoded` folder focuses on decoding smart contract activity into human-readable tables on the Dune platform. This guide is essential for analysts and developers who want to understand and access the decoded data of smart contracts, events, and function calls on the Dune platform.\n\nThe guide covers the following topics:\n\n1. **Call Tables**: This section explains how Dune parses all message calls and transactions made to smart contracts in their own tables. It provides information on how the tables are named and how they are created on an individual contract level or a class of contracts. It also highlights a common misconception about `pure`, `read`, or `constant` functions not being recorded in Dune.\n\n2. **Event Logs**: This section covers the concept of event logs in smart contracts and how they are decoded into tables named according to a specific schema. It provides examples of how to name tables for the V2 Engine (Spark SQL) and V1 Engine (PostgreSQL) and how to look at event logs of a transaction in Etherscan.\n\n3. **Decoding Process**: This section explains how Dune uses the ABI (Application Binary Interface) for smart contracts and the interface standard for standardized token smart contracts (ERC20, ERC721, etc.) to create tables for each event and function defined in the smart contract's ABI. It provides an example of decoding an ERC20 transfer event log and how to understand decoded data.\n\n4. **Accessing Decoded Data**: This section provides examples of how to access decoded data for specific events and function calls using the V2 Engine (Spark SQL) and V1 Engine (PostgreSQL). It also explains how to check if contracts are already decoded by querying the `[blockchain].contracts` tables or using a dashboard.\n\n5. **Which Tables to Use**: This section discusses which tables to use (events or calls) and provides queries to explore decoded contracts, such as seeing all projects with decoded data or checking for multiple instances of a contract.\n\nThis guide is useful for analysts who want to access and analyze decoded data from smart contracts, events, and function calls on the Dune platform. For example, an analyst might use this guide to understand how to access decoded data for a specific ERC20 token transfer event or how to explore all projects with decoded data on the platform. By understanding the decoding process and how to access the decoded data, analysts can gain valuable insights into smart contract activity and interactions on the Dune platform.",

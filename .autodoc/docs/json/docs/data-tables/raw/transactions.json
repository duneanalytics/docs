  "summary": "# Transactions\n\nThis section of the app technical guide covers transactions in the Ethereum network. Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts that initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. Transactions always originate from externally owned accounts, and a smart contract cannot initiate a transaction. Transactions need to be broadcast to the whole network, and any node can broadcast a request for a transaction to be executed on the EVM. After this happens, a miner will execute the transaction and propagate the resulting state change to the rest of the network. \n\nThe official Ethereum documentation provides more information on transactions [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions).\n\n## Tables\n\nThis section of the app technical guide provides a table of the V2 Engine (Spark SQL) and V1 Engine (PosgreSQL) for different chains. The table lists the chain, table, and notes. \n\n### Example\n\nAn example of the table is shown below:\n\n|   Chain           |   Table               | Notes |\n| ----------------  | --------------------- | ----- |\n| Ethereum Mainnet  | `ethereum.transactions`     |  |\n| Gnosis Chain      | `gnosis.transactions`       |  |\n| Polygon           | `polygon.transactions`      |  |\n| Optimism          | `optimism.transactions`     | No EIP1559 so does not contain  `access_list`, `max_fee_per_gas`,`max_priority_fee_per_gas`, `priority_fee_per_gas` and `type` is always `Legacy` |\n| Optimism (legacy) | `optimism_legacy_ovm1.transactions` | No EIP1559 so does not contain  `access_list`, `max_fee_per_gas`,`max_priority_fee_per_gas`, `priority_fee_per_gas` and `type` is always `Legacy` |\n| BNB Chain         | `bnb.transactions`          | No EIP1559 so does not contain  `access_list`, `max_fee_per_gas`,`max_priority_fee_per_gas`, `priority_fee_per_gas` and `type` is always `Legacy` |\n| Arbitrum          | `arbitrum.transactions`     | No EIP1559 so does not contain  `access_list`, `max_fee_per_gas`,`max_priority_fee_per_gas`, `priority_fee_per_gas` and `type` is always `Legacy`. Gas is measured in `ArbGas` instead of `wei` |\n| Avalanche C-Chain  | `avalanche_c.transactions` | Does not contain. Gas is measured in `nanoavax` instead of `wei` |\n\n## Column Data\n\nThis section of the app technical guide provides a table of column data for transactions. The table lists the column, data type, and description. \n\n### Example\n\nAn example of the table is shown below:\n\n|  Column  **            |  Data type   |  Description                                                   |\n| -------------------------- | :-----------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `block_time`               | _timestamptz_ | The time when the block was mined that includes this transaction |\n| `block_number`             | _int8_        | The length of the blockchain in blocks                     |\n| `value`                      | _numeric_     | The amount of `[chain_gas_token]` sent in this transaction in `wei`.

It lists the column name, data type, and description. The column data includes information such as the time when the block was mined that includes this transaction, the length of the blockchain in blocks, the amount of `[chain_gas_token]` sent in this transaction in `wei`, the gas limit in `wei` (ArbGas for Arbitrum), the gas price in `wei`, the gas consumed by the transaction in `wei`, the maximum fee per gas the transaction sender is willing to pay total (introduced by EIP1559), the maximum fee per gas the transaction sender is willing to give to miners to incentivize them to include their transaction (introduced by EIP1559), the priority fee paid out to the miner for this transaction (introduced by EIP1559), the transaction nonce, unique to that wallet, the transactions index position in the block, a true/false value that shows if the transaction succeeded, the address of the sender, the address of the receiver (null when it's a contract creation transaction), a unique identifier for that block, and more. \n\nOverall, this section of the app technical guide provides a detailed description of transactions in the Ethereum network, including tables and column data.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the Transactions table in this app and what data does it contain?\n- The Transactions table contains data on transactions from various blockchain networks, including Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, and BNB Chain, among others. It includes information such as the block time, block number, gas limit, gas price, gas used, and transaction hash, among others.\n2. Does this app support EIP1559 and how is it reflected in the Transactions table?\n- The app supports EIP1559, but not all blockchain networks included in the Transactions table have implemented it. For networks that have implemented it, the Transactions table includes columns for `max_fee_per_gas`, `max_priority_fee_per_gas`, and `priority_fee_per_gas`.\n3. How does this app handle gas measurement for different blockchain networks?\n- Gas measurement varies across different blockchain networks, and the Transactions table reflects this by using different units of measurement such as `wei`, `ArbGas`, and `nanoavax`. The table also includes columns such as `effective_gas_price` and `gas_used_for_l1` to account for gas measurement differences in specific networks like Arbitrum."

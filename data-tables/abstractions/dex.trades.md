# dex.trades

### Decentralized exchange trading data

Decentralized exchanges are the beating heart of the industry. You can swap any ERC20 token for any ERC20 token through the magic of smart contracts. The problem here though: there is so many decentralized exchanges out there that it is hardly possible for any single person to work with the smart contract data for all of them. That's why we created dex.trades.

This table standardizes and normalizes the trading data across virtually all relevant decentralized exchanges. This in turn allows you to easily query for trading data for your favorite tokens without having to deal with all of the different dex smart contracts yourself.

The scripts that generate the table dex.trades can be found in this [public github](https://github.com/duneanalytics/abstractions/tree/master/ethereum/dex) repo.

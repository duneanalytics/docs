!!! note
    Community data is only available on V2 Engine.

While Blockchain data is cool on it's own and we do our best to prepare, standardize and work with that data, sometimes a bit of off-chain data or augmented on-chain data is needed as well. Therefore, we are starting to partner with selected organizations that stream their data directly to Dune.

We are still building out the infrastructure for this endeavor and can therefore not support more datasets at the current moment.

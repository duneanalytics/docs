## How to Get Support

If you can't seem to find the help you're looking for, here's the best way to get it:

### 1. Try searching using the Search bar above

We know you probably did that already but just in case

### 2. Discord!

We have a very active community of Dune Wizards in our Discord. If you're not already a member, you can join by clicking the button below:

<a href="https://discord.gg/dunecom" target="_blank" class="button button--primary button--lg">Join Discord</a>


## How to Leave Feedback

For general Dune app feedback, [leave a suggestion on our Canny board here](https://feedback.dune.com/).

If you're working with any of our public repositories (e.g. Spellbook), you can also open a Github issue.

For Docs feedback fixes or additions, click the pencil icon to the right of the page title and open a GitHub issue or submit a pull request:

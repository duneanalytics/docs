# How does Dune get it's data ?

We are working together with node providers across the Industry to ingest data into our database. This includes all raw historical data from these blockchains. It does not include state data.

We don't discriminate against any smart contract, you can submit any contract via our [decoding page](../../tables/decoded.md) and work with it in a matter of hours. The only prerequisite for this is an ABI so we can actually decode the contract (usually the ABI is already on Etherscan, but there are edge cases).

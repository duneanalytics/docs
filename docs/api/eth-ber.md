description: Welcome to the Dune API ETHBerlin Hackers! Get started with the Dune API here.

Welcome hackers! We are excited to see what you build with our APIs.

## Getting an API Key
Here are the best ways to get an API key from us:

1. Find us at our booth!
2. Email us at [api@dune.com](mailto:api@dune.com)

## Important Links
 - API Documentation - you're already here, check out the sidebar to learn more!
 - [#dune-api Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/757637422384283659/1019910980634939433)
 - [API Client (Community Sourced)](https://dune.com/docs/api/quick-start/community-clients/)

## Picking a Programming Language
While you can consume our API in the language of your choice - see the [API Reference](../api-reference/authentication) section - we currently have quick start guides for [Python](../api/quick-start/api-py) and [Node.js](../api/quick-start/api-js).

## What to Build
With Dune, you have access to almost all of the data from today's most popular blockchain ecosystems. There is no limit to what you can build on top of this data!

With so many possibilities, it can be challenging to figure out what to work on at times, so here are some ideas to help you ideate:

### ETHBerlin Sponsor Bounties

Of course, [we have a Bounty available](https://github.com/ethb3rlin/sponsor-bounties/issues/6) for you to earn cash and prizes for doing cool things with our API.

You can also find inspiration in the [open- and main-track bounties](https://ethberlin.ooo/hacker-manual/#prizes-bounties), as well as those from our [awesome fellow sponsors](https://github.com/ethb3rlin/sponsor-bounties/issues).


### New Kinds of Interfaces for Blockchain Data

Our community champion [@0xBoxer](https://dune.com/0xBoxer) has this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/ez3VfcfNwvc) where he walks us through creating a [dashboard](https://dune.com/0xBoxer/gas-tracker-dashboard) for personalized metrics for any wallet.

With the Dune API it's possible to build a much nicer interface for this or any dashboard on Dune inside of your own super-smooth, super-cool app UX.

Or Excel, Google sheets, Notion Pages, Discord Bots, Telegram Bots, there are no limits.

With the API, the Data Can Flow anywhere!

### Real World Examples from Cow Protocol

[@bh2smith](https://dune.com/bh2smith) from our community (and [Cow Protocol](https://dune.com/cowprotocol)), gave a talk Thursday at [DuneCon](https://dunecon.com) where he walked us through some real-world examples of how Cow Protocol has been using the API.

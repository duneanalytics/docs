!!! note
    This course is based on Dune's V1 engine. Much of the content is still applicable, but the SQL dialect and some table names have changed in Dune V2.

In collaboration with the Dune Team and Community, our friends at OurNetwork created a course with an ambitious goal: teach 30 people web3 data analytics in 30 days.

Hosted by some of our community's top Wizards, you can now access the presentations for free!

As it covers all of the important topics you'll need to know to effectively analyze blockchain data and become a full-fledged Dune Wizard, it's one of the best places to start your Dune Journey.

More details and all of the course materials can be found here:

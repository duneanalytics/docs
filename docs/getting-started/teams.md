**Dune Teams are shared workspaces for Wizards to collaborate within.**

## Why Teams?

Creating a Team several benefits:

1. **🤝 Collaborate on the same content.** Teams make it easy for multiple Wizards to work on shared Queries and Dashboards.
2. **🗂 A separate workspace for each Team.** Keep your personal work separate from the Teams you work with. Easily access your Team’s Queries and Dashboards through My Creations.
3. **🖼 A new Team profile.** Showcase all of your Team’s work in one place.
4. **👥 User roles.** Onboard Team members as viewers, editors or admins.

## Getting started

### Creating a Team

Head over to [**Settings > Teams**](https://dune.com/settings/teams) to create your Team.

Make sure to add a bit of ✨ to your Team’s profile. Here's ours: [**@dune**](https://dune.com/dune)

### Adding users

You can invite other Dune Wizards to join your Team in the People section of your Team’s Settings page. When you invite someone you'll need to input their Dune Username ([have them sign up here](https://dune.com/auth/register) if they don't have one yet).

You'll also need to assign them one of the following **Roles**:

- 👀 **Viewer:** can see the Team’s content through My Creations and will be listed as a Team member in the Team page.
- ✏️ **Editor:** in addition to the above, they can create and edit Queries under the Team’s domain.
- ⚙️ **Admin:** in addition to the above, they can manage the Team and its content.

!!! info
    When you invite a Wizard to join your team we'll email them a link to join. They can also directly go to [Settings > Teams](https://dune.com/settings/teams) and accept their invite there.

### Team content

Team Queries and Dashboards are created the same way they are for individual accounts. When you’re prompted to save them for the first time, you can pick your Team as the Owner so your teammates can also access your new Query/Dashboard:

### Transferring content to your Team

You can transfer any Query or a Dashboard you own to your Team by going to the Query's or Dashboard’s settings and changing the owner there:

!!! warning
    Once you transfer content to a Team, you will only be able to transfer it out of the Team if you are an Admin. If you accidentally transfer content to a Team you will have to ask your Team's Admin to transfer it back to you.

### Finding your Team’s content

Go to My Creations. Here you can see all of your personal content as well as your Team’s. You can filter by owner to narrow down your search:

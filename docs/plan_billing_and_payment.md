## Plans
We offer four different pricing plans for every type of user and team. Here, we'll walk through each one and what it means to upgrade or downgrade your account.

### Account on Dune
There are two types of account on Dune, user account and team account. A **user account** is tied to an email address and is what you use to log into Dune. A **team account** is a shared team workspace. You can create a team account and add unlimited users to your team. _A user can belong to multiple teams._ [Visit this page](../docs/app/teams.md) to learn more about how to create a team and add users. 

Please note that both user and team share domain spaces -- i.e. if user alice claimed the handle "alice", then you will not able to create a team with handle "alice".

### User Plan on Dune 
There is one type of user plan on Dune -- Free Plan. Each plan comes with 2,500 free credits for each billing period.

### Team Plan on Dune 
There are four team plan options. Each paid plan comes with a distinct set of features. It's possible to use Dune for free indefinitely, depending on your use case and with certain limitations.

Visit [dune.com/pricing](https://dune.com/pricing) to see a comprehensive comparison of all of our plans and distinct set of features accompanying each.

1. Free -- 2,500 monthly credits 
2. Plus -- 25,000 monthly credits 
3. Premium -- 100,000 monthly credits 

## Biling & payment information & invoices

**You have set a set billing date for each month.** Your account will be be billed on the same billing date every month. For example, if you subscribed on August 11, 2023, then your billing date will be the 23rd of every month. So the next billing will come on September 11, 2023. 

**We bill you upfront.** You always pay for Dune at the start of your billing interval. We currenlty do not support pro-rated downgrade. If you upgrade from Plus to Premium, we'll prorate how much you'are charged. The credits will be applied at the start of the next billing interval. For more details, see below FAQs.

To view details about your subscription or plan and update your billing information:

- Go to `Setttings` -> `Teams` -> select the team you want to mange -> `Subscription` _(note you can only do this if you are an Admin of the team)_
- Here you can see usage of your team, including credits used for the month, CSV Exports quotas, among others

### Invoices
- Invoices are generated and sent automatically to the team admin's email.
- If you want to manually retrieve invoices, you can go to `Setttings` -> `Teams` -> select the team you want to mange -> `Subscription` and find "Invoices" section. (note you can only do this if you are an Admin of the team)


### Billing FAQs

#### I upgraded from a Plus to Premium plan but why was I charged the full price? 
When you upgrade from a Plus to a Premium plan, the full price of the Premium plan is charged, and the pro-rated credit from your Plus plan is calculated and will be applied towards the **next** invoice. 

For example, suppose you switch from Plus to Premium on July 15th, having initially subscribed to the Plus plan on July 1st. You'll be charged the full Premium price on July 15th and your Premium service will commence from that date. At the same time, we calculate and store a credit corresponding to the unused portion of your Plus plan. This credit will be applied to your next invoice (in this case, August 15th), reducing the overall charge for your Premium plan.

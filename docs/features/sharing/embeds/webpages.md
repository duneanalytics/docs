**Dune Charts can live in your website!**

You can use Dune's embed function to embed the charts usually displayed on Dune Dashboards into your website.

Here is a code snippet example:

`<iframe src="https://dune.com/embeds/208941/391702/2cbe40da-a0e4-43ac-896b-fef6d4d9fda7" height="500" width="500" title="chart 1"></iframe>`

We have seen this feature used on project websites, websites of researchers and basically everywhere by now, the limit really is just your imagination.

A great showcase for this is the [cryptoart.io](https://cryptoart.io/data) website.

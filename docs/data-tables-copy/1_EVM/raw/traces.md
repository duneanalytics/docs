title: Traces
description: Traces tables contain information about the execution of smaller atomic actions generated by transactions.
---

Transactions can trigger smaller atomic actions that modify the internal state of an Ethereum Virtual Machine. Information about the execution of these actions is logged and can be found stored as an EVM execution trace, or just a _trace_. In Etherscan these are referred to as "internal transactions".

## Gas used in `.traces`

The `gas_used` column in the `.traces` tables is a bit hard to understand, so here is some pointers:

- The `gas_used` of a trace will always include the gas consumed by the trace and all it's subtraces.
- The `gas_used` of the initial call will not contain the cost of making the call in the first place
- You need to add 21000 gas units + the cost of sending zero + non zero bytes to the `gas_used` value of the top trace to arrive at the "true" `gas_used` value.

### Description

Transactions can trigger smaller atomic actions that modify the internal state of an Ethereum Virtual Machine. 

One type of trace, `create`, is used to create a smart contract then transfer ether to it.

Hello hackers, welcome to the wonderful world of Dune, we're excited to see what you build with our API!

## Getting an API Key

To get started building on our API, [first create a Dune account here](https://dune.com/auth/register) (if you don't already have one 🧙).

[Then fill out this form](https://forms.gle/JgToag62ZGY58nBh6) and we'll send you an API key as soon as we can (stop by our booth and bug us if you're waiting too long 🪄).

## Important Links

- Our [API Welcome page here](api/index.md) to learn about how our API works
- Our [Quick Start Guides](api/quick-start/index.md) (for Python and JS) to learn how to setup your environment and start executing.
- Our [API Reference](api/api-reference/index.md) section for specifics about our Endpoints
- Our [#dune-api Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/757637422384283659/1019910980634939433) for questions and support!

## Picking a Programming Language
While you can consume our API in the language of your choice - see the [API Reference section](api/api-reference/authentication.md) - we currently have quick start guides for [Python](api/quick-start/api-py.md) and [Node.js](api/quick-start/api-js.md).

## Building Dune Dashboards for your dapp

While we can't add your contracts to our Decoded tables during the hackathon, Dune includes Goerli Testnet raw data so using your smart contract's ABI you can manually decode and get data for any dapps you launch on Goerli!

## What to Build

With Dune, you have access to almost all of the data from today's most popular blockchain ecosystems. There is no limit to what you can build on top of this data!

With so many possibilities, it can be challenging to figure out what to work on at times, so here are some ideas to help you ideate:

### ETHSF Sponsor Bounties

Of course, [we have a Bounty available](https://ethglobal.com/events/ethsanfrancisco2022/prizes#dune) for you to earn cash and prizes for doing cool things with our API.

You can also find inspiration from our awesome fellow sponsors.

### Previous Hackathons

Awesome projects from previous hackathons are also a great way to get some cool ideas:

### New Kinds of Interfaces for Blockchain Data

Our community champion [@0xBoxer](https://dune.com/0xBoxer) has this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/ez3VfcfNwvc) where he walks us through creating a [dashboard](https://dune.com/0xBoxer/gas-tracker-dashboard) for personalized metrics for any wallet.

With the Dune API it's possible to build a much nicer interface for this or any dashboard on Dune inside of your own super-smooth, super-cool app UX.

Or Excel, Google sheets, Notion Pages, Discord Bots, Telegram Bots, there are no limits.
With the API, the Data Can Flow anywhere!

### Real World Examples from Cow Protocol

[@bh2smith](https://dune.com/bh2smith) from our community (and [Cow Protocol](https://dune.com/cowprotocol)), gave a talk Thursday at [DuneCon](https://dunecon.com) where he walked us through some real-world examples of how Cow Protocol has been using the API.

## About Dune

Dune is the leading community-powered crypto analytics platform. Every day, thousands of Dune wizards 🧙 create, find and fork dashboards on Dune to discover and share insights in crypto.

Just by writing SQL, you can query data from all popular L1 + L2 blockchain networks, decoded contracts, and community built “spells” for DEXes, NFTs, stablecoins and more.

Our API is the #1 requested feature and is available in private beta today. With the Dune API, you can custom build an endpoint for your application, and query that data programmatically. Whether you’re building a web3 market intelligence tool or powering the latest in trading strategies, Dune is ready to power your data layer.

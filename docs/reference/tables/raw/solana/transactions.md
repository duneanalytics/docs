### Struct definitions

Within several of these columns is a data type of STRUCT which allows for representing nested hierarchical data and has key-value pairs. It's similar to a dictionary in python and can be used to group fields together to make them more accessible.

An example of how these can be used to extract data: [# of Solana instructions by day for DEXes](https://dune.xyz/queries/416358/794290)

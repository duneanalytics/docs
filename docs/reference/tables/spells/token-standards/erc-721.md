title: ERC-721
description: A smart contract interface standard for non-fungible tokens.
---

The ERC721 standard is the token standard that is used for non-fungible assets on all EVM blockchains. ERC721s can represent digital art, a deed to a house, an insurance policy or even a uniswap V3 liquidity position. The shared property of all these things is that they are not fungible and therefore unique. 

ERC721 tokens are uniquely identified by a combination of `contract_address` and `tokenId`. 

There only ever can exist one of each `tokenId` within each smart contract. an optional feature of the interface is a `tokenURI` property in which the associated media content of the `tokenId` within this smart contract is stored. This mostly is links to decentralized storage solutions like [ifps](https://ipfs.io).

The standard contains many functions similar to ERC20 tokens as it was influenced by it, but does expand on the functionality **** due to the added complexity regarding `tokenId`.

## Methods

```solidity
/* returns the amount of tokens a certain address(_owner) contains */
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256); 

/* returns the owner of a specific NFT, identified by it's tokenId*/
function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);

/* is used to transfer a specific token from the sender(_from) to the receiver(_to)*/
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;

/* is used to transfer a specific token from the sender(_from) to the receiver(_to)*/
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;

/* is used to allow a certain address to move a specific tokenID */
function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;

/* is used to allow a certain address to move any tokenID */
function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

/* returns which address is currently able to move this token. Only one can be active at a time.*/
function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);

/* Tells whether an operator is approved by a given owner. */
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
```

## Events

```solidity
/* gets emitted upon successful transfer of a token. Only one unit can ever be transferred at a time*/
event Transfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId);

/* gets emitted upon the approval of an operator for a specific tokenId */
event Approval(address _owner, address _approved, uint256 _tokenId);

/* gets emitted upon the approval of an operator for all tokens of this collection */
event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);
```

## Tables

In Dune, we decode all erc721 transfer events from all smart contracts into into these tables:

=== "V2 Engine (Spark SQL)"

    **`erc721_blockchain.ERC721_evt_Transfer`**

    This is the event that gets emitted upon successful transfer of a token within a ERC721 smart contract. This can be triggered by either the `safeTransferFrom` or the `transferFrom` functions.

    | Column name |   Data type |    Description |
    | - | :------------: | - |
    | `from` | _string_ | The sender of the `ERC721` token |
    | `to` | _string_ | The receiver of the `ERC721` token |
    | `tokenID` | _numeric_ | The Token ID which uniquely identifies this NFT |
    | `contract_address` | _string_ | The contract_address of this `ERC721` token |
    | `evt_tx_hash` | _string_ | The transaction hash in which this event got emitted |
    | `evt_index` | _numeric_ | This logs index position in the block (cumulative amount of logs ordered by execution) |
    | `evt_block_time` | _timestamptz_ | The time at which the block that contains this event log got mined |
    | `evt_block_number` | _int8_ | The length of the blockchain |

    **`erc721_blockchain.ERC721_evt_Approval`**

    This is the event that gets emitted upon a successful call of the `approve` function.

    | Column name |   Data type |    Description |
    | - | :------------: | - |
    | `owner` | _string_ | The address which gives permission to move this token |
    | `approved` | _string_ | The operator which is able to move the specified `tokenId` |
    | `tokenId` | _numeric_ | The `tokenId` in question  |
    | `contract_address` | _string_ | The contract_address of this `ERC721` token |
    | `evt_tx_hash` | _string_ | The transaction hash in which this event got emitted |
    | `evt_index` | _bigint_ | This logs index position in the block (cumulative amount of logs ordered by execution) |
    | `evt_block_time` | _timestamp with time zone_ | The time at which the block that contains this event log got mined |
    | `evt_block_number` | _bigint_ | The length of the blockchain

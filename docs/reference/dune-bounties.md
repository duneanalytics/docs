How many Holders does BAYC have?

Wanna do some whale watching?

How is the UST depeg going?

How many users are using Uniswap V3 in a day?

Over the past 3 years, Dune has become the go-to solution for answering questions like these via on-demand crypto analytics. 

When it comes to blockchain data analysis, Dune has it all and can do it all, but there's always a frontier left unexplored.

While Dune has created the tools to make ✨ from the 🌀 of crypto data, it's through the skills and bravery of our community of Wizards that data is surfaced and made understandable for projects and the public alike.

Many of the Dashboards and Queries you see on Dune today were made out of sheer curiosity and enjoyment.

Some were done for clout and stars.

But there's nothing like cold, hard, cash to make sure top tier Wizards come to your aid.

## The problem: Wizards + Projects != ✨📊

Projects need data, Wizards want jobs. It's hard for one to find the other.

Until now, analytics tasks have been spread out between Twitter, Discord, Gitcoin, Layer3, Notion boards and a few other dark and hidden places. 

It's hard for **Wizards** to keep track of all these locations they should look for jobs and there's unnecessary friction in the application and work-delivery process. 

For **Projects**, the lack of organization makes it exceedingly hard to find the right Wizard for the job and introduces unnecessary overhead in the management process.

Fundamentally, this problem is solved through the creation of one marketplace for helping Wizards and Projects make the data flow.

This one solution should be able to handle:

- task creation 
- the application process
- communication
- reputation
- payments

and it should be web3 native.

**Thankfully this marketplace now exists!**

## The solution: Dune Bounties

Leveraging [dework.xyz](https://www.dework.xyz), we've set up a bounty board to manage our Dune internal bounty programs - and we've set it up so it's accessible for other projects and organizations to make use of this infrastructure!

Dework describes itself as a “web3 native Trello with payments and credentialing". 

What exactly does that mean?

Let's hear what Lonis, co-founder of Dework, has to say:

Dework offers infrastructure for us to write out tasks on our own [board](https://app.dework.xyz/dune/board) and allows other organizations to seamlessly connect with Dune Wizards by simply specifying “Dune Analytics” as Skill.

All open tasks that have the Dune Analytics Skill attached will appear in the [Dune hub](https://app.dework.xyz/hubs/dune), making it easy for Wizards to find tasks that need their skills.

## For projects in need of Wizards

**If you are an organization in need of web3 analytics, it’s now easier than ever to connect with Dune Wizards!**

You can either do all of this by yourself or ask for our help via the typeform in the "supported approach" tab in the section below, we are happy to help!

=== "Supported approach"

    1. **Fill in this Typeform**  
    
    We know setting up Dework, defining bounties, and managing your contributors can be quite a challenge.
    
    Reach out to us by clicking the button below and filling out our Typeform and we'll happily assist you in onboarding and running successful bounties.

=== "Self Serve"

    [Dework's Documentation](https://dework.gitbook.io/product-docs/guides-for-orgs/getting-started-on-dework) is the best in-depth resource for getting started, but here's a short breakdown for convenience:

    1. **Create an organization**

        If you don’t have a Dework organization yet, the first step is to create one.
        
        At a minimum, we recommend including a description, an icon and a link to your socials so Wizards know who they are working with.

        We also strongly recommend setting up the [Discord integrations](https://dework.gitbook.io/product-docs/guides-for-orgs/connecting-to-discord) to allow for easy communication with the chosen Applicants.
        
    2. **Define tasks**

        After completing the initial setup, you can start creating tasks for anything, but to work with Dune Wizards, you'll want to define tasks with the **"Dune Analytics" Skill"**.
        
        Once you have created a task, the task will be: 
        
        1. in your board and 
        2. in the [Dune hub](https://app.dework.xyz/hubs/dune). 
        
        From there on out, people can find your open task and apply or compete.

    3.  **Choose an applicant**

        If you have defined a task that needs to be assigned to someone, you will get notifications within Dework and can vet the applicant using their work history, GitHub profile and any other attached information on their profile.
        
        We strongly recommend spending time and effort vetting your applicants to have a smooth bounty process.

        Once you choose an applicant to work with, they'll become a Dework "contributor" to your project.

    4.  **Review the work**

        Once the Wizard applicant you have chosen has submitted their work, you can start reviewing the completed task. If it is satisfactory, you mark the task as done and initiate the payment process.

    5.  **Pay your contributor**

        Dework integrates with Metamask, Gnosis Safe, Utopia Labs and even Phantom wallet for Solana based payments. You can choose whatever works best for you and your Wizard contributor here.




## For Wizards looking for work

If you are a Wizard or a aspiring Wizard, join the Dune Analytics organization on Dework and start looking for tasks:

- [On our board](https://app.dework.xyz/dune/board)
- [On the Dune hub](https://app.dework.xyz/hubs/dune)

Be sure to complete your profile with relevant links to your socials, GitHub and Dune profile so organizations can easily assess your skills and decide you're a perfect fit (the easier it is for them to see what you can do, the more likely they'll hire you!).

## Some notes about working on Dune

Dune can roughly be separated into two parts:

- The **App Layer**
- The **Data Layer**. 

In the **App Layer**, you can find [Queries](../app/queries/index.md), [Visualizations](../app/visualizations/index.md) and [Dashboards](../app/dashboards/dashboards.md). 

Everything in the App Layer is public by default and can be utilized by other Wizards, but the work produced in the App Layer is not very persistent and most importantly doesn't enable other Wizard analysts to easily build on top of this work.

Dune's **Data Layer** allows you and the Wizards you work with to produce scalable and persistent work by standardizing and normalizing data. 

We call this data layer [Spellbook](../data-tables/spellbook/index.md).  

A good example of the power of working in the Dune **Data Layer** is OpenSea's standardization and normalization of [all NFT trades across all chains and versions](https://dune.com/spellbook#!/model/model.spellbook.opensea_trades).

By transforming their raw data and adding it to the `opensea.trades` table inside of Spellbook, 2 things can happen:

1. Every Dune Wizard can easily work with OpenSea's data as it's cleaned and standardized.
2. The data can be referenced in other Spellbook tables ("Spells") like `nft.trades`; this makes it even more likely that Wizards will incorporate OpenSea data into their work as the `nft.trades` table contains data from all marketplaces across all chains.

In this way, a project like yours working in the Spellbook Data Layer can get a lot of leverage not only from whatever data analysis projects and visualizations you commission, but by making it more likely other Wizards will find and use your data, build it into their Dashboards, and generate interest in your project. 

Though not necessarily required for your project, getting your data normalized, standardized and possibly inserted into one of our sector level tables like `nft.trades` is definitely recommended!

Once that is done, people working in the **App layer** will have a much easier time building good queries, visualizations and dashboards since the hardest data engineering parts are already taken care of.  

If this all sounds confusing to you, don't worry we can advise you in this process!

Reach out via the [Typeform](https://form.typeform.com/to/DtX4jqkd) in the "Supported approach" tab above, or ask about building your project in Spellbook in our [#spellbook Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/757637422384283659/999683200563564655)!

**TL;DR**
We suggest working in this order so your data flows efficiently:

1. Build Spells in the Data Layer to take care of the data engineering
2. Build cool stuff in the App Layer to surface findings

## Dune Bounties FAQ

### I want to create a requests but how much should I pay/offer?

Dune is an open platform on which you can build all kinds of analysis, Dashboards and Spells, so the official answer here is the dreaded "it depends."

Going rates for Freelance Dune Wizards seem to be anywhere between \$30-\$100 per hour.

And you can always ask in our [#bounty-questions Discord](https://discord.com/channels/757637422384283659/1025371996277706792) or fill out the [Typeform](https://form.typeform.com/to/DtX4jqkd) in the "Supported approach" tab above to get some help on this! 

### Does Dune take a cut of bounty payments?

Dune does not take a cut in any bounty payments.

### I don't have time/capacity to do this myself, can you run this for me?

In some cases, the Dune team can actually run entire bounty campaigns/contests for you, but we can't offer this for every organization.

Fill out the [Typeform](https://form.typeform.com/to/DtX4jqkd) in the "Supported approach" tab above and we'll let you know what we can do to help! 

### How do Wizards get paid for bounties?

Dework has a native payment feature. Wizards simply connect their wallet in their Dework profile and will get paid as soon as the bounty is paid out by the Project that created the task.

### Can I run contests on Dework?

You can indeed run contests on Dework, they are called "multiple submissions."

You can learn more in [Dework's documentation](https://dework.gitbook.io/product-docs/fundamentals/task-types-and-assignee-gating#multiple-submissions).

After running contests it often makes sense to give one of the winners a follow-up task to reconcile the best ideas of all submitted dashboards into one final version.

### Is all of this public?

Dework allows you to define tasks privately and publicly, if you wanted to you could for example limit tasks for only members of your Discord.

### How do I choose the right applicant?

You can click on any profile in Dework to see what the Credentials of the person are.

For example:  
[https://app.dework.xyz/profile/hamzat_iii](https://app.dework.xyz/profile/hamzat_iii)

### What's your recommend approach to organizing bounties for my Project and needs?

Our advice is to first run specific tasks for adding your data to [Spellbook](../data-tables/spellbook/index.md) first and run a Dashboard design contest afterwards.

This way, your data will be easily accessible to any Dune Wizard in any Queries and Dashboards they imagine

Then, by running a contest for Dashboard designs using Dework's "multiple submissions" feature, you'll ensure specific Dashboards you want are created while also leaving room to be surprised by our Wizard's creativity.

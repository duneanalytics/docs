  <em>The world's blockchain data at your fingertips!</em>
</p>



Blockchains are open and transparent, but each chain is unique—making it difficult to understand, ingest, and aggregate data. Dune gives you the proper tools to analyze cross-chain data for different tokens, wallets, and protocols. You can also easily share your work with the community.

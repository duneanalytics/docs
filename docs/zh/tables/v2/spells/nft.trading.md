# nft.trades

## **An easy way of querying for NFT data**

`nft.trades` is an effort to make NFT trading data easily available to everyone on Dune Analytics. This table aggregates and standardizes the data between different data platforms and provides auxiliary information and metadata all in one table.

The culmination of this is a dataset which makes it extremely easy to query for any NFT related trading data across all indexed platforms.

You can find the specifications for nft.trades on our [Spellbook documentation](https://spellbook-docs.dune.com/#!/model/model.spellbook.nft_trades).

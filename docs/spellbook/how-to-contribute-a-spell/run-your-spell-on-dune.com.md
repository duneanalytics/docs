# 🏃♀ Run your spell on dune.com

Copy your spell from the target folder and try running it on dune.com in a new query window.

We are working diligently on a secure sandbox where you can freely run your spells directly from DBT. But in the meantime, the best way to check your work locally is to “compile” your spells.

After you’re [instatited DBT](https://github.com/duneanalytics/abstractions/blob/master/README.md) with \`dbt init\`, run \`dbt compile\`. This will create a new folder called “target”. Inside the target folder will be all of the spells compiled into plain SQL. Then you can copy your spell and run it directly on dune.com.

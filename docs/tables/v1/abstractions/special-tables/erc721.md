# ERC721

### **ERC721 definition**

The ERC721 standard is the token standard that is used for non-fungible assets on all EVM blockchains. ERC721s can represent digital art, a deed to a house, an insurance policy or even a uniswap V3 liquidity position. The shared property of all these things is that they are not fungible and therefore unique. 

ERC721 tokens are uniquely identified by a combination of `contract_address` and `tokenId`. 

There only ever can exist one of each `tokenId` within each smart contract. an optional feature of the interface is a `tokenURI` property in which the associated media content of the `tokenId` within this smart contract is stored. This mostly is links to decentralized storage solutions like [ifps](https://ipfs.io).

The standard contains many functions similar to ERC20 tokens as it was influenced by it, but does expand on the functionality **** due to the added complexity regarding `tokenId`.

**Methods**

```solidity
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256); 
    /* returns the amount of tokens a certain address(_owner) contains */
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
    /* returns the owner of a specific NFT, identified by it's tokenId*/
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
    /* is used to transfer a specific token from the sender(_from) to the receiver(_to)*/
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
    /* is used to transfer a specific token from the sender(_from) to the receiver(_to)*/
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
    /* is used to allow a certain address to move a specific tokenID */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;
    /* is used to allow a certain address to move any tokenID */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
    /* returns which address is currently able to move this token. Only one can be active at a time.*/
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
    /* Tells whether an operator is approved by a given owner. */
```

**Events**

```solidity
 event Transfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId);
 /* gets emitted upon successfull transfer of a token. Only one unit can ever be transferred at a time*/
 event Approval(address _owner, address _approved, uint256 _tokenId);
 /* gets emitted upon the approval of an operator for a specific tokenId */
 event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);
 /* gets emitted upon the approval of an operator for all tokens of this collection */
```

### **Tables in Dune**

In Dune, we decode all erc721 transfer events from all smart contracts into one table `erc721."ERC721_evt_Transfer"`.

#### **erc721."ERC721\_evt\_Transfer"**

This is the event that gets emitted upon successful transfer of a token within a ERC721 smart contract. This can be triggered by either the `safeTransferFrom` or the `transferFrom` functions.

#### erc721."ERC721\_evt\_Approval"

This is the event that gets emitted upon a successful call of the `approve` function.

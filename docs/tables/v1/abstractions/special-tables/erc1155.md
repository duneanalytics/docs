# ERC1155

### **ERC1155 definition**

The ERC1155 standard interface is a multi token standard. It can include any combination of fungible and non-fungible tokens and can therefore be used for a wide range of use cases. Most commonly ERC1155 smart contracts are used today to reflect in-game items and currencies, digital collectibles, art and membership passes, but they really can be used for anything since they combine all properties of ERC20 and ERC721 tokens in a single smart contract. Using a single smart contract for all types of tokens that may exist within a given project saves on gas and complexity during usage and deployment.

Each `id` in an ERC1155 smart contract can have a different `value` of tokens that exist. A non-fungible token will simply have the value 1. Fungible tokens will have a `value > 1`. All ERC1155 tokens are distinct and lack the `decimal` property of ERC20 tokens. In usage, this lack of `decimal` property can easily be corrected for in the frontend of where ever you are dealing with these tokens.

**Methods**

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data) external;
/* transfers a quantity(_value) of a specific token type(_id) from an address(_from) to a receiver(_to)*/
function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] calldata _ids, uint256[] calldata _values, bytes calldata _data) external;
/* transfers multiple token types in different quantities as specified in the _ids and _values arrays. Can only have one sender and one receiver.*/
function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) external view returns (uint256);
/* returns the quantity of tokens for a specific token type for a specific owner */
function balanceOfBatch(address[] calldata _owners, uint256[] calldata _ids) external view returns (uint256[] memory);   
/*returns the balance of mutiple owners and multiple token types */
function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;
/* sets the approval for a certain operator for all token types(Ids) */  
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
/* returns whether a operator is approved for all */
function uri(uint256 _id) external view returns (string memory);
/* returns the uri of the specified id
```

**Events**

```solidity
event TransferSingle(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value);
/* gets emitted after a successful safeTransferFrom call */
event TransferBatch(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256[] _ids, uint256[] _values);
/* gets emitted after a successful safeBtachTransferFrom call */ 
event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);
/* gets emitted after a successful setApprovalForAll call */
event URI(string _value, uint256 indexed _id);
/* gets emmitted when the URI gets changed
```

### **Tables in Dune**

We decode all events of all ERC1155 contracts into the respective event tables.

#### **erc1155."ERC1155\_evt\_Transfer\_Single"**

This event gets emitted when a single type of token within one erc1155 contract is transferred using the `safeTransferFrom` function.

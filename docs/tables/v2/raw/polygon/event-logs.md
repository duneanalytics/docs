# Event Logs

## polygon.logs

This Table stores all logs that get generated by smart contracts. It is sometimes useful for querying contracts that are not yet decoded or are not able to be decoded since the code of the smart contract is not public.

Logs are an elegant way to store tiny amounts of data on EVM blockchains for a small amount of gas. Specifically, event logs are useful to let other people know something has happened without them having to query contracts individually.

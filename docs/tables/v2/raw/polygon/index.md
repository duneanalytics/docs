# Polygon

Polygon(formerly MATIC) is an Ethereum sidechain hosted and maintained by by Polygon Technology. Polygon PoS is a solution that achieves transaction speed and cost savings by utilizing a POS network. Polygon node requirements are significantly higher than Mainnet requirements as Polygon has a higer gas limit and shorter blocktime.

You can read more about Polygon and their approach to scaling an EVM in their [documentation](https://docs.polygon.technology).

Polygon follows all the rules of ETH mainnet and querying on Dune works exactly the same.

# Vote Transactions

## Solana.vote\_transactions

This table contains the full set of vote transactions that are submitted by validators to vote on a block. It can be joined with the non-vote transactions table above to get a full breakdown of all transactions. It has the same schema as the main transactions table.

An example query that demonstrates that is available here: [Solana transactions past 30 days](https://dune.xyz/queries/389976/743760)
